##  1. Why Serverless?

 **The motivation behind choosing serverless architecture instead of traditional server-based hosting:**

**No Server Management:** You don’t need to provision, maintain or scale servers — AWS handles it. This lets you focus on business logic instead of infrastructure.

**Pay-Per-Use Pricing:** You only get charged when functions are executed, which reduces costs during idle times (great for projects with variable traffic).

**Automatic Scaling:** Functions scale automatically with traffic — no need to pre-configure capacity.

## 2. Why AWS Lambda?

**specific reasons for using Lambda functions as the core compute:**

**Event-Driven Compute:** Lambda runs code only when events occur (e.g., new application POST calls).

**Fast Deployment:** Small functions are easy to deploy and update independently.

**Tight AWS Ecosystem Integration:** Works seamlessly with API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.
