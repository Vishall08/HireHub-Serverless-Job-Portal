🧠 1. Why Serverless?

Explain the motivation behind choosing serverless architecture instead of traditional server-based hosting:

No Server Management: You don’t need to provision, maintain or scale servers — AWS handles it. This lets you focus on business logic instead of infrastructure.

Pay-Per-Use Pricing: You only get charged when functions are executed, which reduces costs during idle times (great for projects with variable traffic).

Automatic Scaling: Functions scale automatically with traffic — no need to pre-configure capacity.
